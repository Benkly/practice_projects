A simplified version of Wordle was coded using Python. 

This game functions in the same manner as the official Wordle game:

* The player attempts to guess a five letter word in six attempts. 
* The game tells you when letters are in the correct position, if they are in the word (but misplaced) or not in the word at all.

The text file (`word_bank.txt`) contains 3,103 five-letter words ([Source](https://gist.github.com/shmookey/b28e342e1b1756c4700f42f17102c2ff)) to generate a healthy sized word bank to randomly pull words from.
